<div class="title">About XTrkCAD</div>
	<p>
		<span class="hilite">XTrkCad</span> is a CAD program for designing 
		model railroad layouts. Using it, you can
		<ul>
		<li>design layouts in any scale and gauge,
		<li>use the predefined libraries for many popular brands of 
		turnouts to help you get started easily,
		<li>add your own favorite components, 
		<li>manipulate track much like you would 
		with actual flex-track to modify, extend and join tracks 
		and turnouts,
		<li>test your design by running trains.
		</ul>
		<p>
		Learning  <span class="hilite">XTrkCad</span> is made easy with the 
		extensive on-line help and demonstrations. 
		<br>
		<span class="hilite">XTrkCad</span> is available on Windows and on LINUX.
		Being a open source project, you won't even have to pay for it!
