<div class="title">Scale Definition</div>
	<p>
	The SCALE definition looks like:
	
		<div class="code"><pre>

SCALE O, 48.0, 1.1770
      1536,24,960
      2016,30,1200
      2592,36,1440
		</pre></div>
		<dl>
			<dt>O</dt>
			<dd> is the name of the scale,</dd> 
			<dt>48.0</dt> 
			<dd> is the ratio and</dd>
			<dt>1.1770</dt> 
			<dd>is the track gauge in inches.</dt>
			<dt>Easement</dt>
			<dd>
				The next 3 line define the R, X, and L values for Sharp, Normal and
				Broad easement curves.  This are in prototype inches. You can copy
				these from another scale which close to the desired scale.  The exact
				values are not critical.
			</dd>
		</dl>

<div class="title">Parameter File</div>
	<p>
	
		The parameter file is not meant to be edited manually.  However the lines are
		(and subject to change):
		<dl>
			<dt>U</dt>
		  <dd>
				this is the information entered on the turnout designer dialog for this
				definition
			</dd>
		  <dt>P</dt>
			<dd>
				define the Paths thru the turnout, the numbers specify the track segments,
				numbered from 1
			</dd>	
		  <dt>E</dt>
			<dd>
				are the turnout's End-Points (X, Y, Angle)
			</dd>
			<dt>S</dt>
			<dd>
				is a straight track segment (color, line width,  X1, Y1, X2, Y2)
			</dd>
			<dt>C</dt>
			<dd>
				is a curved track segment (color, line width,  Radius, Center-X, Center-Y,
				Starting Angle, Angular Length)
			</dd>	
		  <dt>L3</dt>
			<dd>
				is a straight line (color, line width, X1, Y1, Z1, X2, Y2, Z2)
			</dd>	
		  <dt>A3</dt>
			<dd>
				is a curved line (color, line width, Radius, Center-X, Center-Y,
				Center-Z, Starting Angle, Angular Length)
				Color and line width are not used for track segments (and are 0)
				A negative radius in a Curved track segment means the path thru the segment is
				flipped
				<br>
				Color for lines is the RGB value encoded as (Red*65536+Green*256+Blue)
				Z values are always 0 (for now)
			</dd>
